        Thinking is the root cause of all suffering. There is no other answer to
        why we feel negative emotions other than that it is from our own
        thinking. Everything can be traced back to our thinking, which makes
        problem solving very simple. Once we realize that our thinking is
        causing how we feel, we can let go of it and we return to our natural
        state of peace, love, and joy. When we let go of our thinking, it
        creates space for us to be able to allow all positive emotions we want
        to feel to surface from within us. We donâ€™t live in reality, we live in
        a PERCEPTION of reality, which is created by our own thinking. Thinking
        is NOT an effect of our experiences, but the CAUSE of it
